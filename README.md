Lionel Messi Tribute Page - Responsive Web Design
A responsive web project paying tribute to Lionel Messi's free-kick goals, designed to demonstrate mastery of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Responsive Design.

Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure (header, main, section, footer) and picture tag for responsive images.

CSS3 (Advanced):

CSS Grid: Utilized grid-template-areas for complex, adaptive layouts.

Animations: Custom @keyframes (like text-focus-in and slide-in-bck-center) for engaging UI elements.

Media Queries: Mobile-First approach with specific breakpoints (500px, 768px, 1024px).

Framework: Bootstrap 5 (for navbar and base styling).

Key Features
Dynamic Layouts: The layout shifts completely from Mobile to Desktop using CSS Grid areas.

Optimized Assets: Uses the HTML <picture> element to serve different image sizes based on device width.

Interactive UI: Hover effects on gallery items (transform: translateX).
